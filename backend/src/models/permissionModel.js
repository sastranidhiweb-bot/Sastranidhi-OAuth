/**
 * Global permissions are what gate the Admin API -- deliberately scoped to
 * user_roles rows with application_id IS NULL. A role assigned *within* an
 * application (e.g. "ADMIN" scoped to LMS) grants admin rights inside that
 * child app's own domain, not over this Identity Provider itself. Only a
 * globally-assigned role administers the IdP.
 *
 * (An earlier version of this file checked ANY role regardless of
 * application scope, which would have let an LMS-scoped TEACHER -- who has
 * courses.manage within LMS -- also pass admin checks on this server. That
 * was a real privilege-scoping bug, fixed by the application_id IS NULL
 * filter below.)
 *
 * This is looked up fresh from the database on every admin request rather
 * than trusted from the access token's "apps" claim -- a role change should
 * take effect on the next request, not wait out the token's 15-minute
 * lifetime.
